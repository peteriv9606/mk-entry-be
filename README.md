# mk-entry-be
 
This is an Express.js Backend project (Part2). [Front-End](https://github.com/peteriv9606/mkit-entry-fe)

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies using:

```
yarn install
```

Then, you need to create a .env file with:
```
MONGO_URI=<YOUR_MONGODB_URI>
TOKEN_SECRET=<YOUR_SECRET>
```

^This is needed for database usage (users and stuff), and authentication (JWT)

Then, run server using:
```
yarn dev
```
